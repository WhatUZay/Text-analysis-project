The Viksit Bharat - International Economics Summit is a formal event organized by HSNC University. The event consists of speaker sessions and panel discussions. We were also tasked with conducting a research on student's perspectives on the topic "Viksit Bharat @2047".
HSNC University collected 682 responses from its students, alternatively the student committee (TEFKC) has collected 274 responses with another set of questions.

The jupyter notebook is an attempt to summarize the results from both parties via visualizations. The images folder contains images to mask the wordclouds and the data file contains the data for the project
